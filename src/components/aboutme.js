      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Throughout my professional career I have seen countless examples of individuals in management positions, most of whom possess master's degrees, and it is my goal to one day break into a management position through education and experience.
        Continuing into a master’s program directly after completing my undergraduate coursework this Spring 2021 at Lehman College would be the next logical step in accomplishing the goal of becoming a Cybersecurity manager.</p>

      <p>What I see myself doing professionally upon graduation is working in a Cybersecurity position for the government or for a public or private company.
        Since young, I have always been interested in computers, electronics, and technologies.
        My interest in Cybersecurity came later in life when I was introduced to hacking, coding, and programming.
        Within an emerging field such as Cybersecurity, the sensitivity of the work requires moral integrity.
        The individuals involved will be just as important as the work being done and those individuals who can show strong character and good moral judgement will be successful in spreading the collective interest within the Cybersecurity field.
        I am confident in saying that I am one of these individuals who want to dignify Cybersecurity and fulfill its goal of making the internet a safer place for all.</p>

      <p>The key actions I have taken up to this point to prepare myself for a career in Cyber Security is paying close attention to the Cyber Security industry and the major changes that have been occurring.
        For example, one of the biggest emerging markets has been the widespread deployment of the 5th generation mobile network, more commonly known as 5G.
        The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) has recently selected Nokia and other collaborating companies to participate in a 5G Cybersecurity Project.
        This may prove to be groundbreaking for all companies utilizing 5G due to the resources available to the U.S. government.</p>

      <p>Another key action I have taken up to this point to prepare myself for a career in Cybersecurity is applying to various positions such as the CIA, the NYC Cyber Command Center, the Cybersecurity Talent Initiative program, and various public and private companies.
          Last year, I was offered a Cybersecurity position with the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, but declined due to conflicts with my undergraduate coursework schedule.
          It is my belief that even more opportunities such as these will be available upon the completion of a master’s degree at John Jay and I’m excited for an opportunity to participate.</p>

      <p>Overall, a master’s program is the next step to achieve my goal of becoming a Cybersecurity manager.
        Not only would the information being learned be invaluable, but the people and connections made could potentially elevate my success in the Cybersecurity field for years to come.</p>
